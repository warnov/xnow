# xnow
This is a Windows Forms Application (Net Framework) useful to be used as a customizable application launcher.
You can setup a keyborad binding inside your Windows to open it quick and write immediately the command you want to be executed.
After you press enter, the application just hides in the notifications of the taskbar and you can call it again pressing ctrl+shift+*: It will be more than ready for another command.
Besides "normal" Windows commands, you can create a folder of custom shortcuts with short names taht could be invoked from the *xnow*. 
For example you can create a shortcut link called vs.lnk, put it in the special folder you create for this and then just write inside xnow: "vs" and press enter. In this moment Visual Studio will open without requiring you to fill your taskbar with shortcuts or having to open the start menu.
